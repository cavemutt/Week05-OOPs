# Week05-OOPs

Using JavaScript Object Oriented Programming, I have created a little game where you create a battle team to save your small Middle Earth village from invading orcs. 
The assignment required at least one array and at least two classes to be used and the options to create, view and delete elements. 


There are two battle teams, one is the invading orcs which are automatically created after the hero team is created by the user.  
The user needs to create a Hero Team then add 3 members using the strings suggested, adjusted to not be case sensitive, and the user receives an error if not correct. 
The user then needs to view the Invading team, at which time it is created.
The user can then proceed to initiate the attack.

The stats are randomized within ranges but the user can improve their chances by choosing an appropriate weapon for their character. 
The stats also change when called again, I could find a solution to that if I had more time, but for now let's just call it a case of "team dynamics" at work. 

If teams are not created or containing three members, they cannot move forward. They will receive error messages, but after a few errors, the game gets tired of the shenanigans and crashes. Again, if I worked on it more, I would hope to find an answer to that. 

Otherwise, it works as intended.
Thank you for checking it out, please enjoy!
